# recipe_app
To whomever it may concern, I wish you a warm welcome to my recipe_app!

I created this project so that I could learn more about python and github.

Before anything else I would like to mention that I am still learning and therefore may have used horrendous coding practises. I apologize for any insult this may have done and I am open to any changes my code could use.

Anyway...

This is a Recipe App that I created in my learning process and isn't actually something that would be helpful in real life BUT it does work so far.

Feel free to give it a run, note that you would need your own API_KEY, the one I'm using is hidden as an evironmental variable. You can get your own API_KEY for free at this link: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Authentication
